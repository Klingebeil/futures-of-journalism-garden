Itâ€˜s been a long-held belief of mine, that journalism doesnâ€˜t have to mean media in the traditional sense. Everyone with access to publishing tools can act like a journalist â€” i.e. reporting and contextualizing observations and data â€” but not everyone feels beholden to ethical guidelines, the journalistic ethos of the traditional business model of journalism. Furthermore, the digital present is changing the role of traditional journalists as well. 

More and more we can see hybrid roles emerging, which mix journalism with design, coding, project management or even more exotic skills. Opening up the field of journalism to those experiences might open up a new way of defining the practice itself. Journalism after journalists and journalists after journalism.

### Examples

- [[Indie-Journalism]]

- [[Climate Reporting]]
