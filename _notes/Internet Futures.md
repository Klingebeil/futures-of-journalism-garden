### Splinternets
Arguably there was never anything akin to a truly "world wide web". The experience of the internet has always been shaped by local laws, language, available plattforms and service-providers. The idea of splinternets carries this experience a step further by describing almost completely closed-off networks.

One prominent exmple is the Chinese internet, which is almost impossible to leave from within China, also dubbed "the great firewall". A more tame example, though, might be the European internet. Through legislation such as the GDPR certain American businesses decided to block European users from their services.
