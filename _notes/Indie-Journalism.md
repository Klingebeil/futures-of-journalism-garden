The "journalist as entrepreneur" is the latest way for journalists to go "indie", i.e. monetizing their work not through a publisher but directly through a paying audience. This move has become increasingly easy through plattforms such as *Patreon*, *Memberfull* or newsletter plattforms such as  *Substack* and *Revue*.

Though, as noted in [[Influencerâ€”Journalists]] this move has the possibility of compromising the image and credibility of journalists.

A form of entrepreneurial journalism is also the emergence of [[New Local Media]]. Small local outlets build often involving minimal overhead, small teams and a focus on digital media.

> As of year one, I am sad to report: I cannot yet retire or purchase a yacht. I am delighted, however, to report that the *Explorers Club* covers my base costs of living. I live fairly simply so these costs are perhaps lower than yours. That said, I donâ€™t live like a hermit, have a comfortable studio / home, big enough to frequently host other artists and writers, and like to cook with fancy butter.
