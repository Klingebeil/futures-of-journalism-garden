## What's this about?
This is a more experimental version of a trend report for journalism. It's based on my work under the umbrella of the "Futures of Journalism" research project I started almost two years ago as a Are.na-channel.


## Start with these topics

- [[Emerging Practices]]—The variations of journalism jobs emerging at the moment.

- [[Infrastructure]]—Notes on the changes of the technical infrastructure which journalism online has to rely on.

- [[Auto—Augmentation]]—The changes brought by tools augmenting or automation certain tasks.

- [[Fractal Society]]—A theory to move beyond the idea of filterbubbles and towards a fractal view of society, as groups within groups within groups.
