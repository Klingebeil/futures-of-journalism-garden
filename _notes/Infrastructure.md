## Social Infrastructure
With social media plattforms and search engines facilitating a big part of the interaction between a publisher and its audience, news organizations arguably have no control over how and where there content gets delivered online.

And even in the best cases this relationship favors positioning and power of the platform, while shaping the rules of said relationship. A famous example of the changing rules might be the "pivot to video" by *Facebook*â€”a strategy change by the company towards more video content in its feeds. Through botched numbers and a prominent PR-campaign the company build a mirage of possible higher ad-revenues prompting publishers to lay-off writers in favor of video reporters. A critical mistake since *Facebook* didn't deliver on the promised returns, resulting in a second wave of lay-offs and even closures.

This is just on example of what I've come to call [[The Algorithm]]â€”a stand-in for the number of algorithms and systems shaping the output, strategy and structure of publishers.
